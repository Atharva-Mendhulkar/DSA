# 📚 DSA - Learning & Practice Repository

This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts that I am learning and practicing.  
It serves as a **self-study journal** where I document my progress in **Competitive Programming (CP)** and **DSA problem-solving**.

## 📌 What’s Inside?

- 🏗 **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hashing, etc.
- ⚡ **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Greedy, Backtracking, etc.
- 🏆 **Problem-Solving**: Solutions to **LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces** problems.
- 🎯 **Competitive Programming**: My practice submissions, contest solutions, and optimization techniques.

## 🚀 How I Use This Repo

- **Learning DSA**: Implementing and revising core concepts.
- **Solving Problems**: Applying knowledge to solve CP problems.
- **Tracking Progress**: Keeping a record of my improvements and coding strategies.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
